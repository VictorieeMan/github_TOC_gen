Prerequesites: Python 3

1. Go to a readme folder and copy the file name column holding alt key pressed.

2. Save column data to the filenames.txt file

3. Run the program and add the content of TOC.md to a README.md file in your repo, then add abstracts to each headline.

You now got a TOC readme for your folder that hade relative links and overview abstracts for you.

Further development; it is possible that you could have an OpenAI or other LLM model generate summaries of each file for you.
